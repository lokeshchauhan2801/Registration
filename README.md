  <p>This project allows you to register people into a MySQL database using a Tkinter GUI.</p>
  <h1>MyRegistration Application</h1>
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>The MyRegistration Application is a Python and Tkinter based GUI application that allows users to register new people with their details including name, age, gender, email, and mobile number. The application also allows users to search, delete, and fetch all the data from the database. The application is built using the MySQL connector for Python to connect and interact with the MySQL database. The application is fully functional and can be used as a template for building more complex registration systems.</p>
  <h2>Installation:</h2>
